/*
* This implementation is "Improved Noise" as presented by
* Ken Perlin at Siggraph 2002. The 3D function is a direct port
* of his Java reference code which was once publicly available
* on www.noisemachine.com (although I cleaned it up, made it
* faster and made the code more readable), but the 1D, 2D and
* 4D functions were implemented from scratch by me.
*
* This is a backport to C of my improved noise class in C++
* which was included in the Aqsis renderer project.
* It is highly reusable without source code modifications.
